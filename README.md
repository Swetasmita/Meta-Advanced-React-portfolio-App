Portfolio App - Advanced React Course by Meta


Description
This portfolio app was developed as part of the Advanced React Course by Meta to showcase my skills and projects using React. The app includes various sections such as a header with external and internal links, a landing section with a bio, a project showcase, and a contact form.

Features
Header
External links to social media accounts are functional and take users to the respective platforms.

Internal links smoothly scroll to their corresponding sections.

Landing Section
Displays an avatar, name, and a short bio.

Project Section
Projects are displayed in a 2x2 grid using card widgets.

Each project card includes a title, description, and links to the live demo and source code.

Contact Me Form
A fully functional contact form with required business logic (e.g., validation, submission handling).

Header Animation
The header is hidden/shown based on scroll direction with a smooth transition animation.
